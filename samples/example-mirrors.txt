# Example mirror configuration file.
#
# Add a "Mirror" command like this for every mirror that you want to list.
# Note: you need to list the main repository too.
#
# The "name" is a helpful name of the mirror.
#
# The "urlbase" is the top-level of this mirror's copy of the repository.
# For example, if urlbase is http://foo.bar/baz/, then Thandy will expect
# to find the keylist at http://foo.bar/baz/meta/keys.txt.
#
# The "contents" list should contain a list of file paths patterns for
# which parts of the repository can be found at this mirror.  For example,
# if this list is [ "/meta/*", "/pkginfo/tor/**" ], then this mirror
# keeps up-to-date copies of all files in /meta/, and all files in any
# subdirectory of "/pkginfo/tor".
#
# The "weight" field is an INTEGER representing the relative weight with which
# we should pick this mirror.

Mirror(name="moria",
       urlbase="http://updates.torproject.org/thandy/",
       contents=[ "**" ],
