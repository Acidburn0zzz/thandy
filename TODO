- get messaging sorted
o try to write up a registry-based exe version checker.,
- Decouple install from check: they are not necessarily related.

. Download improvements.
  o Back off on download failure.
  o Handle full stalled file in download.
  - Use if-modified-since on timestamp

o Write client-side code
  o Decide early if a python implementation will do for v1.
     o Adjust httplib, urllib2 to use socks4a.
       o Check SOCKS package for suitability as basis for socks4a support?
     o Look into best packaging practices

  o Write code to run, telling another process about status,
    eventually coming up with a list of packages to install or an
    "A-OK" signal.

  D GUI

  o DL-via-Tor
  o Install-when-done
  o Verbose output
  o quiet output.
  X Rendezvous-back with Tor when done.

- Better configurability: let users override mirrors, keys, etc.
- Backend for "A bunch of files you can unzip someplace."
- OSX backend (hard).
- Proper exponential back-off on download backend.

- Wrapping
  - More unit tests

. Documentation
  - More comments, more tests
  o Document EXE and RPM formats in HOWTO.
  . full pydoc
  - revise spec

- Testing
  - Much bigger unit tests.

o Bugs Roger keeps noticing
  o you can add the same role to a key twice.
  o wishlist item: thandy-pk dumpkey-all
    o Already there: Run "thandy-pk dumpkey" with no arguments

- Confusing tracebacks that could use a check and error message:

If you type the wrong password,

thandy.BadPassword

   [ I maintain that BadPassword _is_ an error message.  I'll make it say
     "Password Incorrect", though, so it looks less like a bug.]
