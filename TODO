o get messaging sorted
o try to write up a registry-based exe version checker.,
o Decouple install from check: they are not necessarily related.
  o Generate newer, better objects internally.
  o Generate new, better formats for existing 'exe' items
  o Generate command items properly.

- Better version comparison.

- Security stuff that we should do
  1 Check SSL certs or something in urllib2.  Not that Thandy really cares
    about repositories getting mitm'd.
  3 Notice exceptionally slow bandwidths; treat as failure-like.
  5 Make sure we actually verify that timestamps in files listed in ts
    file match ts file's declared timestamps for them.  Spec this.
  6 Never replace a file with one that has an older timestamp.  Spec this.
  7D Fallback locations to find starting metafiles in, if we don't have
    any cached yet.

- Security stuff that we should do that needs format changes.
  2 Whenever we list a hash in a metafile, also list a file length.

- Think more about issues 4, 7(A,B,C)

- Missing packaging features:
  - Generate multi-item packages properly.
  - Transition better for checking on a given item
  - Implement remove
  - Get RPM actually more tested
  - Get install-from-compressed-file working.
  - Transaction support where available.
  - OSX backend

. Download improvements.
  o Back off on download failure.
  o Handle full stalled file in download.
  - Use if-modified-since on timestamp

- Better configurability: let users override mirrors, keys, etc.
- Proper exponential back-off on download backend.

- Wrapping
  - More unit tests

. Documentation
  - More comments, more tests
  . full pydoc

- Testing
  - Much bigger unit tests.
