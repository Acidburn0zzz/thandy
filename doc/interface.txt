Thandy client interface:

   thandy-client update [options] [bundlename...]

Recognized options are:

   --repo=<dir>    Store downloaded, finished information under <dir>.
                   Defaults to ~/.thandy/cache

   --no-download   Only decide what to download; don't actually download
                   anything.

   --loop          Do not exit after we have nothing more to download; keep
                   waiting until there's something to do.

   --no-packagesys Do not ask any underlying package system about what
                   versions of things are installed.  Assume we need to
                   fetch all packages not in the cache.

   --install       Try to install packages after downloading them.

   --socks-port=<port>
                   Run all network operations over the SOCKS4a server at
                   localhost:<port>

   --debug|--info|--warn
                   Set logging severity.


   --force-check
                   Download a fresh version of the timestamp file, whether
                   we need it or not.


02:55 < nickm> Right now, for a quick-and-dirty thing, vidalia can notice the 
               specific form of the "Ready to install files:" message.  It can 
               turn into something more formal later.
02:56 < nickm> The only 'suggestions' thandy-client understands now are ones 
               from command-line options, all of which are documented.
02:56 < armadev> ok
